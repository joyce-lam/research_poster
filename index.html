            There is growing evidence to show that music intervention reduces the perception of pain in orthopedic post surgical patients when coupled with pharmacologic interventions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Across three days postoperative, patient’s pain improved on average 1.25 points in the group listening to music versus the 0.25 point increase in the control group (Gallagher, 2018).
            <br>
            <br>
            Based on a 0-10 pain scale, average pain scores went from 5.43 before listening, to 3.97 after listening. Listening time had no effect on pain reduction (Schneider, 2018).
            <br>
            <br>
            Less pain was reported in patient’s listening to music at 3 hr and 24 hr postoperatively in total knee arthroplasty (Simcock, 2008).
            <br>
            <br>
            One study did not find statistical significance, however there was a significant drop in pain scores suggesting clinical significance. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Studies agree that the use of music is inexpensive, easy to use, and can aid in managing pain symptoms.

            The inclusion of music therapy, in addition to standard pharmacological interventions, is effective in reducing pain.
            <br>
            <br>
            Based on clinical findings, it is recommended that music therapy is implemented in the patient’s care plan to reduce post-operative pain.

            Since each individual has a different perception on what type of music is considered relaxing to them, patients should be given the option between different music selections. However, these music selections should share characteristics of being harmonious, relaxing, easy to listen to, and should be around 60-80 beats per minute. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Music therapy is applied to patients as an adjuvant to the administration of medication for every dose. Patient will determine how long the music is on, but recommendation should state that music should be on at least an hour or two while medicating. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Educating the patients about music therapy should be done in preoperative preparation to allow the patients to choose their music and will be made  available to them at recovery.   
            <br>
            <br>
            Nurses will  have to educate patients that music therapy is not limited to be only utilized in the hospital setting. We have to make sure that the patients take this knowledge and use it for their own benefit at home.

            Patient will complete preferred pain scale an hour after pain medications are given. With the implementation of music therapy, the expected outcome is a decreased pain rating.  
            <br>
            <br>
            Upon discharge, patients will complete “Patient Satisfaction Survey” with likert-scale type questions. The expected outcome is an increase in satisfaction during hospitalization.  
            <br>
            <br>
            During routine assessments, the  nurse will directly ask the patient if they find the addition of music therapy to be helpful. The expected outcome is that the  patient verbalizes positive feelings towards the music and verbalizes its help in reducing pain.

            The studies shows that postoperative patients’ pain levels decreased when listening to music as part of recovery.  
            <br>
            <br>
            It was agreed upon that music therapy is not only an effective intervention for pain management in postoperative patients in an orthopedic setting, but it is also inexpensive, accessible, and easy to use.   
            <br>
            <br>
            Music therapy can be used in hospital setting or at home. Nurses must educated patients on the effectiveness of continued utilization of this intervention after discharge.
